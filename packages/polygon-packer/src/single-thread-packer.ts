 * Single-threaded polygon packer for synchronous nesting operations.

 * - Working with small polygon sets
 * - Web Workers are not available
 * - Synchronous operation is required
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const packer = new SingleThreadPacker();
 * packer.start(config, polygons, binPolygon);
 * const result = packer.nest();
 * console.log('Best placement:', result);
 * ```
